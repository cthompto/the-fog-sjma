Could see nothing
in the fog.

---
fog gives to things 
exaggerated dimensions and 
an unnatural appearance.
---
Still fog, which the 
sunrise cannot pierce.

---
as though fixing upon
one unshakable solidity
in a world of fog
---
estimates frequently exceed
the correct range when
made during foggy weather
---
Here the fog prevents
the enemy from being 
discovered in time
---
friction and the fog of 
war will always be the chief
characteristic of real war
---
to see him in spite of
fogs and darkness

---
Outside the fog of battle,
with its absorbing
interests and distractions
